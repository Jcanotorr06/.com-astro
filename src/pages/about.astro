                I am a fullstack developer and software engineer working out of Panama City, Panama, 
                and I am constantly looking for ground-breaking solutions to 
                issues that arise in daily life. In my work, I spend most of
                my time coming up with innovative solutions to development
                problems, and I am always looking for ways to improve my
                skills and learn new technologies.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I have been part of this industry for almost two years now,
                and within that time, I've honed my analytic and collaboration
                skills which makes working with a team easier, regardless of
                the size or skills of the team members. I am always looking for
                opportunities to help others and to learn from them.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Even though I stumbled upon this industry by chance, I have
                found a passion for it. But like they say, "Good things come
                to us with a plan", no? I especially enjoy watching my ideas
                come to life and seeing the impact they have on the people
                around me.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For me, each project I have the privilege of working on is
                a new opportunity to learn and grow as a developer, meet new
                people with ideas that differ from mine and discover things 
                that I never knew existed.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I enjoy playing videogames and watching movies, particularty mystery 
                thrillers like  "Memento" and "The Prestige". I listen to lots of music,
                and David Bowie and JID are probably the ones I listen to the most (for now).
                If I'm not working on a project, then I usually spend most of my free time in
                the gym or with my friends, dogs and family.
